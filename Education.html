        </legend>
            <ul>1. Hands on learning</ul>
            <p> "The structure of the courses are focused around hands on learning   
            which i personally find beneficial as it fosters deeper understanding  
            allowing me to actively engage with real world concepts and challenges". </p>
            <ul>2. Great learning environment</ul>
            <p>
