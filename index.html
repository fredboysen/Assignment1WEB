                <h3>Marketing Research Calculator</h3>
                <p> During the third semester project, I had the responsibility of creating an application which could give the user 
                    a quick and easy overview of a selected country’s score based on relevant factors in market attractiveness and the company’s own competitive strengths. 
                    The application was created using JavaFX. This application was used in order to establish a business plan for a company which we worked with through the project
                     which goal was to emerge into new markets possibilities primarily the US, Japan and China. </p>
                <h3>Solar Energy Management Application and Investment Assesment</h3>
                <p> Creating a database and solar panel monitoring system/application which aim was to easily monitor the input for any errors of each panel, output and efficiency of the solar panels. 
                    The application was created to store these data into a database where the user could monitor the output throughout a specific time period. 
                    During the project I also helped develop an investment plan of solar panels which would cover the potential efficiency, savings and costs for the company. </p>
